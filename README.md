# Denoising images with Autoencoders

**NOTE:** This project is an optional excercise from Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.

The idea is to use an Autoencoder architecture to denoise images. We're gonna be using MNIST dataset for this exercise.

Autoencoders are a type of Neural Network architecture that are able to learn a representation or encoding, and reconstruct to the original input, or decoding. There are a few interesting uses such as: compression, dimensionality reduction or denoising are some of the applications of Autoencoders.
